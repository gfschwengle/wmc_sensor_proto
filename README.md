# wmc_sensor_proto
This repo contains everyhting about the project:
- PCB_design: KiCad board design
- firmware: PlatformIO firmware design
- docs: datasheet and images

Still to do;
1. Calibrate the sensor, use a reference sensor. (not tested, atm no reference sensor).
2. Test the system MQTT, to communicate with a raspberry PI (not tested)
3. SD card read and write (Tested, failed)
