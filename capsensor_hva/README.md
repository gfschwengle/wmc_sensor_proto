# Capsensor HVA

High Voltage Capacitive Sensor for Wood Moisture Content Detection

## Overview

This project implements a capacitive sensor system for measuring wood moisture content. The system consists of custom hardware (PCB design) and embedded firmware.

## Project Structure

- `firmware/` - PlatformIO-based embedded firmware
- `hardware/` - KiCAD PCB design files and manufacturing outputs
- `docs/` - Project documentation

## Getting Started

See the documentation in the `docs/` directory for detailed information on:
- Hardware design and assembly
- Firmware development and deployment
- Building and testing the system

## License
