# Capsensor HVA Documentation

Welcome to the Capsensor HVA project documentation.

## Project Overview

The Capsensor HVA is a high-voltage capacitive sensor system designed for measuring wood moisture content. The system uses capacitive sensing techniques to non-invasively determine moisture levels in wood products.

## System Architecture

The Capsensor HVA consists of three main components:

1. **Hardware Platform**
   - Custom PCB with high-voltage capacitive sensing circuitry
   - ESP32-based microcontroller
   - Power management and communication interfaces

2. **Firmware**
   - Embedded software running on the ESP32
   - Sensor data acquisition and processing
   - Communication protocols

3. **Documentation**
   - Hardware design files and assembly instructions
   - Firmware development guides
   - Build and testing procedures

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Hardware Documentation](hardware.md) to understand the PCB design
2. Read the [Build Guide](build.md) for assembly instructions
3. See the [Firmware Documentation](firmware.md) for programming the device
